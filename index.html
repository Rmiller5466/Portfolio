              Hello, I am a student at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio.  I am working towards a Master's Degree of Computer Science.  Hoping to further develop
              my skills as a software developer.

             I tutor beginner level Computer Science courses CS 1180 & 1181, Computer Science 1 & 2.
             I have worked with multiple students, helping them reinforce understanding through explanation and practice.
             I was even able to help a student who was working in a language that I was not familiar with.</p>

              I worked with the technology department within my high school.
              I was mainly responsible for computer maintenance, while also assisting students and staff who had questions and problems.
              Work also included research in educational software followed by implementation within the learning environment. </p>

            <p>
              I have made an effort to learn aspects of web development on my own, as I have not taken any formal education on it yet.  I have used sources
              such as freeCodeCamp and Udemy.  This portfolio site is the only notable project I have done so far.

            <p class="project-header"> CS3100 - Data Structures and Algorithms</p>
            <p>
              Projects done in this class focused mainly on data structures as well as getting familiar with the C++ language
              Projects done focused on wokring with a "database" of information.  I made generic implementations of queues, linked lists, and binary trees
              in order to manage aspects of the database such as addition, removal, and searching.  All projects were done in the console.

            <p>
              Projects done in this class helped reinforce the basics of programming as well as building on some more advanced concepts. The following is
              a list of projects and what skills/concepts they built upon.

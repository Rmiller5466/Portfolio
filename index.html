                <p>
                    The focus of 3180 included working with and understanding the foundations of different programming styles. Projects were done in Racket (Functional),
                    Ruby (Object Oriented), and Python (General Purpose /  Interpreted). These projects included: Blackjack (Racket - Console or GUI), Binary Search Tree (Ruby), and
                    a simulated card game with statistics (Python, Matplotlib).

                <p>
                    Work done in this class inculded working with and understanding file systems as well as modifying and implementing features within a bare bones
                    console written in C/C++ provided by the professor. In the console we were tasked with implementing features such as piping, redirection, and 
                    backgrounding processes.  Within the file system I implemented creating, moving, and removing directories, as well as files in specific cases, 
                    commands for displaying files in current directory as well as printing out the current directory path, 
                    and the ability to create soft and hard links.

                <p>
                    Projects done in this class focused mainly on data structures as well as getting familiar with C++.
                    Projects focused on working with a "database" of information. I created generic implementations of queues, linked lists, and binary trees
                    in order to manage aspects of the database such as addition, removal, and searching. All projects were console based.

                    Projects done in this class helped reinforce the basics of programming as well as building on some more advanced concepts. These projects included:
                    Math Quiz, Shortest Path Algorithm, Ceasar Cipher, Grocery Store Simulation, Tik Tac Toe.

                    I have made an effort to learn aspects of web development on my own, as I have not taken any formal education on it yet. I have used sources
                    such as freeCodeCamp and Udemy. This portfolio site is the only public project I have available. I have also learned some Node.js and have an
                    in-progress project where I am learning authentication techniques and database implementation.  Currently focusing on getting familiar with and learning React.
